    <h1>Hello, dweller of Earth</h1>
    <p>
        Hi. I am Abidur. To be honest with you, the sole purpose of this file is making sure you don't get the default 404 when you visit here. That is all. Life can lack meaning like that at times. We are all stuck on a rock, floating through a possibly infinite expanse, only able to experience an almost insignifant fraction of the passage of time and space. So it goes. But I hope that doesn't get you down. We are all in this together. To you, my brave explorer of cyberspace, I wish the best for the rest of your life. I really do hope you enjoy it. Peace and love.
